## Introduction

UpDuck is a Golang CLI that helps developers create on-premise datacenters for self-hosted applications. The key point is to use already existing tools and just orchestrate them. Just configuring tools seems to be the easiest part of the journey but it starts to hurt when you have to manage all these tools at the same time.

### Features

- [x] Private networking with WireGuard
- [x] Reverse proxy tunneling with Nginx (DNS forwarding)
- [x] Container orchestration with K3s (installed on servers)

## Installation

### Build from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/duck-labs/upduck.git
cd upduck
make build
sudo mv ./upduck /usr/bin/upduck
```

### Install as system service

To install UpDuck as a server node:
```bash
sudo upduck install server
```

To install UpDuck as a tower node:
```bash
sudo upduck install tower
```

## Usage

> **Note**: Commands are organized hierarchically. Network-related commands are under `upduck network` and DNS commands are under `upduck dns`. Available commands depend on your node type (tower vs server) and are enabled after installation (`upduck install <type>`)

### Tower Setup (Control Node)

1. **Install as tower**:
   ```bash
   sudo upduck install tower
   ```

2. **View your tower's public key**:
   ```bash
   upduck network connections
   ```

3. **Create a network**:
   ```bash
   upduck network create
   ```

4. **Allow a server to connect**:
   ```bash
   upduck network allow <server-public-key-digest>
   ```
> requires to run `upduck network connections` on a server to get its digest

5. **Forward a domain to a server**:
   ```bash
   upduck dns forward example.com <server-id> 3000
   ```

### Server Setup (Worker Node)

1. **Install as server**:
   ```bash
   sudo upduck install server
   ```

2. **Get your server's public key**:
   ```bash
   upduck network connections
   ```

3. **Connect to a tower network** (after tower has allowed your key digest):
   ```bash
   upduck network connect <tower-domain> <network-id>
   ```
> needs to run `upduck network create` on a tower to generate a new ID (that is also listed in `upduck network connections`)


## API Endpoints

### Tower Endpoints

- `POST /api/servers/network/{network-id}/connect`: Server connection endpoint for a specific network, exposed only by the tower and used by the server's `connect` command:
  ```json
  {
    "public_key": "server-public-key",
    "wg_public_key": "server-wireguard-public-key"
  }
  ```

- `GET /health`: Health check endpoint

## Configuration

UpDuck stores configuration in `/etc/upduck/`:

- `config.json`: Node configuration (stores generic config like if node is a server or tower type);
- `wireguard-config.json`: WireGuard keys, generated during the setup;
- `connections.json`: WireGuard network and peers list and, for the tower, a list of allowed keys digest data;
- `public-key.pem` and `private-key.pem`: RSA keys for API encryption;
- `wg-config/`: Directory containing WireGuard interface configuration files.

For development/testing, you can override the config directory and start both the tower and the server on the same machine:
```bash
# starting the tower
UPDUCK_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/upduck-tower" sudo -E ./upduck server --type tower --port 8081

# starting the server
UPDUCK_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/upduck-server" sudo -E ./upduck server --type server --port 8082

# on the tower: create a network and get the network ID
UPDUCK_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/upduck-tower" ./upduck network create

# on the tower: allow the server (get server's key digest first)
UPDUCK_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/upduck-server" ./upduck network connections  # get server key digest
UPDUCK_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/upduck-tower" ./upduck network allow <server-key-digest>

# making the server connect to the tower
UPDUCK_CONFIG_DIR="/etc/upduck-server" sudo -E ./upduck network connect 127.0.0.1:8081 <network-id>
```

### Building

```bash
make build
```

## Architecture

UpDuck uses a tower-server architecture:

- **Tower**: Central control node that manages servers and provides reverse proxy. Must be used within a server that has a public IP available;
- **Server**: Worker nodes that run applications and connect to towers, mainly servers on the homelab.

The system uses WireGuard for secure networking and provides HTTP APIs for management.

A RSA key-pair is generated to ensure end-to-end encryption of the management API's.
